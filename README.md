Passwordless login example using JUNO platform

The demo shows a backend integration with Sideos JUNO SSI platform and a simple front end to demonstrate login and logout using SSI.
It requires the SIDEOS TRANSPONDER app, which can be downloaded from the android and iOS stores.

The server does a simple check on the credentials to verify that the ISSUER is someone trusted, and then accept all emails.
In a real use case the email may be checked against a real user in the system.
